Dear friend, I share with you this document to provide you simple solutions to enforce a little bit the security of the awesome application.

1. First thing first, you are using HTTP instead of HTTPS, that means that all your communications are readable.

You can use and configure NGINX with a TLS certificate or Kubernetes Ingress. You can obtain certificates from cloud providers.

Do not forget to update your file `index.html` `API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';` to `const API_URL = 'https://your-domain.com:8000';` (you should not print it in your code).

2. There is no Authentication or Authorization in all your application so anyone can use it.

On the API side, you can integrate an authentication library (FastAPI's security utilities with JWT with expiration date).

* Add an endpoint for user registration/login.
* Require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header for the /message (create) endpoint.
* Use a decorator on relevant endpoints to enforce authentication.

By doing this you enforce the security of your API.

On the Frontend side, you have to allow the user to log in and obtain a JWT. That will be used to log into the API.

3. (API) The CORSMiddleware configuration in your main.py is correctly set up for local development, but it presents a security vulnerability if used as-is in a production environment.
   You know where all the requests come from, you should only allow them on your API.
   You know what type of methods your API executes, you should exclude all the rest.
   Same thing for the headers. Knowing that, this is what I suggest to you:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["https://your-domain.com"],  # Replace with your actual UI domain
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["POST", "GET"],
    allow_headers=["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
)
```

4. (API) On your get message path, you directly execute the query that the frontend sent to you — it's not a secure way to proceed. You open the door for injections of NoSQL commands.
   For example, if I call the backend like this `http://127.0.0.1:8000/message/{"$where": "1 == 1"}` it will return to me the first message in your database.

You can fix this issue by using an identifier in your query and give it to your method `find_one` like this: `collection.find_one({"identifier": identifier})`.
You should also check if the identifier is in UUID format.

5. (API) All your secret messages are stored in plain text in your database. That means if someone has access to your database, he could read all your top secret messages.
   In order to resolve this issue, you can encrypt (Fernet) your message before putting it into your database and maybe (you can give it encrypted) decrypt it before giving it to your user.

In order to do encryption, you will need an ENCRYPTION\_KEY that should be very secret and not exposed to anybody.
I suggest you to put it in a secret manager where you can retrieve it easily (Kubernetes Secrets or Vault).

6. "Malicious Messages" (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)
   **Problem:** Raw message content injected into `innerHTML`.

**Technical Solution:** Already implemented in the updated `index.html`!

The `index.html` now includes the DOMPurify library.

Before displaying the message (`messageDisplay.innerHTML = ...`), the content is sanitized:

```js
const cleanMessage = DOMPurify.sanitize(data.message);
messageDisplay.innerHTML = cleanMessage;
```

This removes any potentially malicious scripts or HTML tags, making the displayed content safe.

7. Secure all your passwords. In the docker-compose files, you write in plain text your password to connect to the DB.
   You should use dedicated secret management. As I mentioned for the ENCRYPTION\_KEY.

You can create Kubernetes Secret objects to store sensitive data or use an external secret manager like Vault and synchronize it with your Kubernetes secret object.

8. Control the flow in order to avoid potential abuse or DoS by rapid requests.
   You should implement server-side rate limiting. You have many solutions. You can use the rate limit solution of your Python framework (FastAPILimiter) or use your Ingress controller.

9. Check the libraries you are using to avoid as much as possible vulnerabilities.
   You can use pip-audit to perform a scan of your requirements and even automate the scanning in a CI/CD pipeline.
   You can also scan your container image to detect vulnerabilities.
   Integrate Snyk, Trivy (for container image scanning which also covers dependencies), or Dependabot (for GitHub repos) to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities and suggest updates.

10. Password in your logs — you should pay attention to what you put in your logs. We can see that you clearly print your database password in your logs.
    `api-1 | INFO:main:Connected to MongoDB at mongodb://myuser:mypassword@mongodb:27017/mydatabase with database mydatabase`
    I suggest you to avoid putting the URL with password in the log. If you really need the URL in the logs, you can also replace your password using the `re` library as follows:

```python
pattern = re.compile(r'(:)([^@:]+?)(@)')
data = pattern.sub(r'\1***\3', url)
```

And this will replace the password in your URL by `****`.

11. You should limit the amount of characters in your message to avoid exposing yourself to resource abuse.
    I tried to send a very long message and I got this error. You should maybe handle the size of the message before trying to write it in the database:

```
api-1 |   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pymongo/network.py", line 140, in command
api-1 |     message._raise_document_too_large(name, size, max_bson_size + message._COMMAND_OVERHEAD)
api-1 |   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pymongo/message.py", line 1025, in _raise_document_too_large
api-1 |     raise DocumentTooLarge(
api-1 | pymongo.errors.DocumentTooLarge: BSON document too large (22364355 bytes) - the connected server supports BSON document sizes up to 16793598 bytes)
```

12. You use an over-privileged user for your database. You can use a simple user who has the `readWrite` role.
    After consulting the image you use ([https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mongodb](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/mongodb)), I can suggest you to configure a new user in your `docker-compose.yaml` by adding these environment variables:

```yaml
- MONGODB_USERNAME=apiUser 
- MONGODB_PASSWORD=secret_password
- MONGODB_DATABASE=your_database_name
- MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
```

13. To conclude, I suggest you build a CI process that will help you to guarantee the quality, the maintainability and the security of your code.

1- Write some unit tests in the API part. You can use pytest for it. It will help to make sure that everything works as expected and detect any change of behavior in your code.
2- Use tools that analyze your code for programmatic errors like `ruff` or `flake8` for Python. You can also use `eslint` for your HTML.
You should also try to monitor your application by using a dedicated tool to centralize all your logs. You have some tools like elastic search that you can combine with kibana to display all the logs and have some graphics about the usage of your application and all the error.
